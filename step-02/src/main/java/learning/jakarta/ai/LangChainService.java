For example, multiple threads can independently execute tasks, such as processing user requests or performing background computations.

                    Concurrency is about managing multiple tasks that can overlap in execution, even if not at the same time. Parallelism, on the other hand, involves executing multiple tasks simultaneously, requiring multiple processing units like CPU cores. Think of concurrency as juggling tasks and parallelism as working on multiple tasks side-by-side.

                    2. Implementing the `Runnable` interface and passing it to a `Thread` object.
