**Building AI-Powered Java Applications: From Zero to RAG with JakartaEE and LangChain4j**  

---
AI is no longer a distant future—it’s reshaping enterprise software *today*. For Java developers, integrating AI into applications can feel overwhelming, but it doesn’t have to be. In this immersive **4-hour workshop**, you’ll learn how to harness Large Language Models (LLMs) to supercharge your JakartaEE applications with cutting-edge AI features.  

We’ll start from the ground up, combining **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** with JakartaEE to build an AI-powered backend for an e-commerce system. Using **LangChain4j**, you’ll create RAG pipelines that merge the contextual precision of your data with the generative power of LLMs. By the end, you’ll deploy a fully functional system with **summarization**, **semantic search**, and **dynamic Q&A** capabilities—all backed by an embedding database.  

**Key Learning Outcomes**:  
- Integrate LLMs into JakartaEE applications with confidence.  
- Design **few-shot** and **zero-shot** RAG models for domain-specific tasks.  
- Build a production-ready embedding database for similarity search.  
- Implement AI-driven features like automated product descriptions and customer support.  
- Optimize performance and cost for enterprise-scale deployments.

### **Workshop Agenda**  
#### **Part 1: Foundations (60 mins)**  
- **AI in Enterprise Java**: Use cases, challenges, and JakartaEE’s role.  
- **RAG Demystified**: How retrieval + generation solves hallucination issues.  
- **Tools & Setup**: LangChain4j, PostgreSQL + pgvector, OpenAI API.  
- *Hands-on*: Clone the starter repo and configure your environment.  

#### **Part 2: Building the RAG Pipeline (90 mins)**  
- **Zero-Shot vs. Few-Shot Learning**: When to use each approach.  
- **Step-by-Step**:  
  1. Ingest and chunk domain-specific data (e.g., product specs).  
  2. Generate embeddings and store them in a vector DB.  
  3. Query LLMs with hybrid prompts (context + user input).  
- *Hands-on*: Implement a product Q&A system using custom data.  

#### **Part 3: Advanced Features (75 mins)**  
- **Summarization**: Automatically condense customer reviews.  
- **Semantic Search**: Find similar products using natural language.  
- **Hybrid Architectures**: Combine rules-based logic with LLM flexibility.  
- *Hands-on*: Add a review summarizer to the e-commerce backend.  

#### **Part 4: Deployment & Best Practices (45 mins)**  
- **Cost Optimization**: Caching, model selection, and token management.  
- **Security**: Sanitizing LLM inputs/outputs in enterprise environments.  
- **Monitoring**: Tracking accuracy, latency, and drift.  
- *Group Activity*: Troubleshoot a misbehaving RAG pipeline.
