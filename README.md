---

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone this project to your local machine.
   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:rokon12/llm-jakarta.git
   cd llm-jakarta
   ```

2. **Set the OpenAI API Key**: Export your OpenAI API key to an environment variable.
   ```bash
   export OPENAI_API_KEY=<your-api-key>
   ```

3. **Build and Run the Application**: Use the following command to clean, package, and start the application in development mode with WildFly.
   ```bash
   ./mvnw clean package wildfly:dev
   ```

4. **Access the Application**: Once the application starts, open your browser and navigate to:
   ```
   http://localhost:8080/llm-jakarta
   ```
5. **Additional Step for RAG Feature (Step 04-06)**: When leveraging the RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) feature, you must specify the directory containing the documents by exporting the following variable

 ```shell
 export LLM_JAKARTA_DOCUMENTS_DIR=<document_dir>
 ```
Replace `<document_dir>` with the path to your documents directory.

**Some of the steps require a database.** To simplify we have added a docker-compose.yml in the "deploy" directory.
 ```shell
 docker-compose up
 ```
